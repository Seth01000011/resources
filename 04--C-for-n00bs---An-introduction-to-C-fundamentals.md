- reconness - ReconNess helps you to run and keep all your #recon in the same place allowing you to focus only on the potentially vulnerable targets without distraction and without required a lot of bash skill or programing skill in general.
With ReconNess you can put all your learning effort only on how to exploit the targets using one specific kind of vulnerability for example and at the same time you are sure that your #recon is good and organized.
